This blog is made with Hugo, a Go static site generator. The theme is PaperMod.

To run the site locally, run `hugo server`. Site will run on port 1313.

To run the site and see draft posts, run `hugo server -D`.

For some reason, hot reload doesn't seem to work great when adding images, so kill the server and restart if you want to see how your images are looking.
